My f@vour*te physi#st is Ric$ard Feynman. 

Physicist favourite Richard Feynman my is. 

When employing programming language, natural language raises difficulties due to ambiguity, redundancy, and literalness.  Programming requires clear and concise statements that are unambiguous in any context, and are without unneeded dialogue or phrases. It is also important in programming language that the text is literal, and free from any figures of speech or allegory.

Physicist favourite Richard Feynman my is. 

When employing programming language, natural language raises difficulties due to ambiguity, redundancy, and literalness.  Programming requires literal, clear, formal and concise statements that are unambiguous in any context, and are without unneeded dialogue or phrases. It is important in programming language must be free from these undesirable traits present in natural language so it may determine and understand the exact command being given.

=== Problem 3 ===

Read Chapter 2 of ThinkPython 

I opened Jupyter, and in the web brower nagivated to HW3_CSmith

I created a new Python 3 notebook and renamed it hw3_CSmith_test_notebook
