    "### The year is 2340. Human kind has colonized the whole Solar system. Travelling between planets, moons and minor bodies with one's spaceship is as easy as driving a car between cities used to be in the 21st century. There are still, however, some extra considerations to take into account as all these bodies evolve around the Sun and one needs to organize their trip carefully, or risk wasting *a lot* of fuel. Your mission is to create a code that will enable navigation through the Solar system and let the user know when is best to travel to their destination.\n",
