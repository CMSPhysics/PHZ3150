My f@vour*te physi#st is Ric$ard Feynman. 

Physicist favourite Richard Feynman my is. 

When employing programming language, natural language raises difficulties due to ambiguity, redundancy, and literalness.  Programming requires clear and concise statements that are unambiguous in any context, and are without unneeded dialogue or phrases. It is also important in programming language that the text is literal, and free from any figures of speech or allegory.

Physicist favourite Richard Feynman my is. 

When employing programming language, natural language raises difficulties due to ambiguity, redundancy, and literalness.  Programming requires literal, clear, formal and concise statements that are unambiguous in any context, and are without unneeded dialogue or phrases. It is important in programming language must be free from these undesirable traits present in natural language so it may determine and understand the exact command being given.

Homework 3 Answers

=== Problem 1 ===

Homework 3 folder made:
PHZ3150_Handin_HW3

=== Problem 2 ===

= A =

I downloaded the GitHub desktop app in a previous lecture, then I opened the desktop GitHub app and followed the following paths to create a new repository:

File_New Repository

Where I named this new repository:

PHZ3150

After naming it I created the repository than pushed repository to web browser GitHub site

= B =

I drag and dropped my log into the Github web browser

CMSPhysics_PHZ3150

It is named 0-PHZ3150-CSmith.log and then commited the changes.  I think went to the GitHub desktop app, refreshed from origin, then pulled from origin to synch the GitHub browser with the GitHub app.

I opened the GitHub web brower and opened 

CMSPhysiscs_PHZ3150

Screen capture was taken via snapshot command WINDOWS+SHIFT+S and saved as:

HW3_CSmith_Problem2BII_Screenshot1.png

= C = 

I then created a new folder named test_git and saved it under revision control in:

CMSPhysics_PHZ3150

= D = 

I copied and pasted the hw1-survey.txt into the new test_git folder. In GitHub desktop I committed the changes and took a screenshot.

Screen capture was taken via snapshot command WINDOWS+SHIFT+S and saved as:

HW3_CSmith_Problem2D_Screenshot2.png

I then pushed these changes to origin. 

I then deleted hw1-survey.txt from the test_git folder, and added the comment Removal as per HW3 problem 2d.

Screen capture was taken via snapshot command WINDOWS+SHIFT+S and saved as:

HW3_CSmith_Problem2D_Screenshot3.png

= E =

I took a screenshot of my history of the changes on the GitHub desktop app.

Screen capture was taken via snapshot command WINDOWS+SHIFT+S and saved as:

HW3_CSmith_Problem2E_Screenshot4.png

=== Problem 3 ===

I opened Jupyter Notebook and started a new Python notebook and named it:

hw3_CSmith_test_notebook. 

I defined the variables x,y, z, w, and q, and performed a multiplication of x and y, subtracted y and x, added 1 to q, and multpilied q by 10.  

I defined a min function to equal 3 and explained in the notebook why the name is erroneous.

Homework 4 Answers

=== Problem 1 ===

Homework 4 folder made:
PHZ3150_Handin_HW4

This folder was then committed and pushed in Github.

=== Problem 2 ===

I created a new python file named:
hw4_CSmith

I created a function to Force [N] from mass[Kg] and acceleration[m/s^2], and printed results for a list of masses and acceleration values.

I created a Force[N] to Acceleration[m/s^2] function, and calculated the acceleration from a list of forces with corresponding mass [150Kg].

=== Problem 3 ===

I opened a new python file named:
acceleration_hw4.py 

I created a function for acceleration from the change in speed [u1 and u2] divided by the change in time [t1, t2].

In the hw4_CSmith python file, I imported the function acceleration and calculated the acceleration for a list of u1, u2, t1, and t2 values.

I verified these results by computing the calculations by hand with a graphing calulator. 

2 possible ways to determine that the code I wrote functions correctly are: 1) compute iterations by hand as I have done above and 2) use another program with built in code/functions such as excel to verify results

***** IN: Sun Jan 30 16:16:34 EST 2022

=== Problem 4 ===

In the hw4_CSmith python file, I imported the function acceleration from acceleration_hw4.py and input values from the hw4 file for velocity and time.

I changed the 5th element in my velocity list to 90 

It did not successfully print as the acceleration function was defined for speed variables u1, u2 and time variables t1 and t2, not for overall velocity and time. 

I copied and pasted my hw4 folder to:

PHZ3150_handin_hw4

Commited these changes on the Github desktop app, pushed the changes to origin and took a screen capture of the changes on the webbrowser.

Screen capture was taken via snapshot command WINDOWS+SHIFT+S and saved as:

2 possible ways to determine that the code I wrote functions correctly are: 1) Use Hypothesis (Library that allows you to generate examples to test to reveal any bugs that may be present in your code) and 2) use the doctest module in python that executes problems within a docstring to verify that the function works exactly as it should.

I sent this log to my handin folder, where I right clicked and created a zipfile for my hw4 python files, this log, and the screen shot. 

I then uploaded the hw4_Smith zipfile to webcourses
